### Build quality in

Quality software comes from quality people. Poor quality software must therefor come from poor quality people. To improve the quality of our software, we remove people who create defects.

### Work in small batches

Too many releases are hard to report and manage. To reduce the number of updates to the release tracking spreadsheet, we produce a small quantity of releases per month. This provides us with more time for [amplifying feedback](#amplify-feedback).

### Amplify feedback

Coaching employees is an important daily practice to ensure they know we are tracking their work and care about their output.

### Everyone is responsible

Each person is responsible for their individual work and should be rewarded for the work they do. If a feature is successfully delivered, we should identify the coder who made the most changes and give them a bonus. It would be unfair to reward the whole team based on the excellence of an individual.

### Psychological safety

We know the [Tribunal](../Release%20Convoy/_index.md#tribunal) can be a stressful time when we need to remove coders. We will use automated systems for "Human Resources as a Service" to automatically help coders find new opportunities outside our company so we can avoid confrontation.
